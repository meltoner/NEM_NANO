Entering the Firmware Update Mode

There are two ways to upload the firmware to FS-i6:

    In the main menu, go to System â­¢ Firmware Update (it is on the second page of the System menu); Select Yes and OK.
    When something goes wrong, it is also possible to use the following:
        switch the FS-i6 off
        push the trims of the left stick rigthwards and downwards, respectively
        while holding the trims in that position, switch the FS-i6 on
